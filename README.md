# Airbnb Price Prediction
This project analyzes and predicts Airbnb rental prices in San Diego using real-world data. The goal was to build a model that estimates listing prices based on features like location, property type, and availability. 

# Skills Used 
- Used Pandas to clean the dataset and preparing it for model training. 
- Used KMeans to cluster locations together and find patterns within those location clusters (using `latitude` and `longitude` data points).
- Used `XGBRegressor` as my model and fine tuned it for optimal results.
- Normamized all of my data using `numpy` for accurate results.
